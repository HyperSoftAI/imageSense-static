                            Please read this section carefully. It affects your legal rights. It provides for resolution of disputes through individual arbitration instead of court trials and class actions. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court, uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and discovery is more limited. Arbitration is final and binding and subject to only very limited review by a court. This arbitration clause shall survive termination of the Terms.

                                    The parties agree that the arbitrator(s) shall have the authority to issue interim
                                    orders
                                    for provisional relief, including, but not limited to, orders for injunctive relief,
                                    attachment or other provisional remedy, as necessary to protect either party’s name,

                                    parties
                                    agree that any interim order of the arbitrator(s) for any injunctive or other

                                    relief shall be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. In addition, nothing

                                    the Terms shall be deemed as preventing either party from seeking provisional relief
                                    from
                                    any court of competent jurisdiction, in order to protect that party’s name or

                                    rights. Nothing in this Section shall be construed as preventing any party from seeking
                                    conservatory or interim relief from any court of competent jurisdiction, including
                                    without
                                    limitation to protect either party’s name, proprietary information, trade secrets,
                                    know-how
                                    or any other proprietary rights.

                            following notice regarding Apple. These Terms are between you and HyperSoft only, not with Apple,
                            and Apple is not responsible for the HyperSoft Service and the content thereof. Apple has no
                            obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the App.
                            In the event of any failure of the App to conform to any applicable warranty, then you may
                            notify Apple and Apple will refund any applicable purchase price for the App to you; and that,
                            to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple has no other warranty obligation
                            whatsoever with respect to the App. Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims by you or
                            any third party relating to the App or your possession and/or use of the App, including: (a)

                            regulatory requirement; and (c) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.
                            Apple is not responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any third
